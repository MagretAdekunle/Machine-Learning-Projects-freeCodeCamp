Requirements
------------

-   Develop a regression model to predict individual healthcare costs using patient demographic and health data.
-   Create a machine learning solution that accurately predicts healthcare costs for patients based on their personal and medical characteristics.
-   Achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < $3500.


Key Features
------------

-   Implements regression algorithms to predict healthcare costs based on multiple patient variables
-   Processes and analyzes healthcare cost datasets containing demographic and medical information
-   Provides accurate cost predictions for new patient data
-   Includes data visualization and model performance metrics

Dataset 
------------

The dataset includes:

- Patient demographics (age, gender, BMI, etc.)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking status, activity level)
- Medical history and conditions
- Current health metrics
- Historical healthcare costs
- 

Technical Implementation
-----------------

-   Built using Tensorflow
-   Handles feature engineering for optimal model performance
-   Employs cross-validation to ensure prediction reliability
-   Includes comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline


Data Processing
-----------------

- Handle missing values appropriately
- Perform feature scaling/normalization
- Encode categorical variables
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets
- Implement data validation checks

Applications
-------------

-   Insurance premium estimation
-   Healthcare budget planning
-   Risk assessment for healthcare providers
-   Individual cost forecasting


Evaluation/Performance Metrics
------------------

My solution will be assessed on:

- Prediction accuracy: Achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < $3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.
- Model interpretability
- Scalability and efficiency
