Requirements
------------

-   


Key Features
------------

-   Implements regression algorithms to predict healthcare costs based on multiple patient variables
-   Processes and analyzes healthcare cost datasets containing demographic and medical information
-   Provides accurate cost predictions for new patient data
-   Includes data visualization and model performance metrics

Technical Details
-----------------

-   Built using [specific ML framework/library]
-   Handles feature engineering for optimal model performance
-   Employs cross-validation to ensure prediction reliability
-   Includes comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline

Applications
-------------

-   Insurance premium estimation
-   Healthcare budget planning
-   Risk assessment for healthcare providers
-   Individual cost forecasting


Evaluation/Performance Metrics
------------------

My solution will be evaluated on:
model.evaluate must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.
