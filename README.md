1\. [Rock Paper Scissors]()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An intelligent agent that consistently outperforms random strategies in Rock Paper Scissors by implementing pattern recognition and predictive modeling. This AI achieves a remarkable 60%+ win rate against automated opponents through strategic decision-making.



2\. [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/MagretAdekunle/Machine-Learning-Projects-freeCodeCamp/tree/main/Cat%20and%20Dog%20Image%20Classifier)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A deep learning model built with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras that accurately classifies images of cats and dogs using convolutional neural networks (CNN). This project demonstrates modern computer vision techniques for binary image classification.

Currerntly at a 90% accuracy!



3\. [Book Recommendation Engine using KNN]()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sophisticated recommendation system that suggests books to users based on their reading preferences, powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Built using the comprehensive Book-Crossings dataset, this system analyzes reading patterns and ratings to deliver tailored book recommendations.


4\. [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator]()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A machine learning model that predicts individual healthcare costs using regression analysis. This project analyzes patient demographic and health data to forecast medical expenses, helping healthcare providers and insurers make informed financial projections.




5\. [Neural Network SMS Text Classifier]()
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A machine learning classifier that automatically identifies unwanted spam messages in SMS communications. This project helps users filter their messages by distinguishing between legitimate personal communications ("ham") and unsolicited commercial messages ("spam").
