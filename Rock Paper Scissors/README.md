Requirements
------------

-   Implement an AI player that competes in Rock, Paper, Scissors matches
-   Your program must face four distinct opponent bots in separate matches
-   Achieve a minimum 60% win rate against each opponent
-   Each match should consist of a statistically significant number of games

Success Criteria
----------------

-   Win rate â‰¥ 60% against all four opponent bots
-   Consistent performance across multiple test runs


Key Features
------------

-   Surpasses traditional random selection (50% baseline)
-   Achieves >60% win rate consistently
-   Implements pattern recognition
-   Adapts strategy based on opponent behavior
-   Real-time performance analysis


Technical Implementation
------------------------

-   Pattern analysis algorithms
-   Markov chain modeling for prediction
-   Historical move analysis
-   Dynamic strategy adjustment
-   Performance tracking and metrics


Strategic Components
--------------------

-   Opponent move prediction
-   Pattern identification
-   Counter-strategy generation
-   Real-time adaptation
-   Win probability optimization


Performance Metrics
-------------------

-   Win rate tracking
-   Strategy effectiveness analysis
-   Pattern detection accuracy
-   Adaptation speed measurement
-   Comparative performance vs baseline
  
Note
----

Simple random selection will not be sufficient to meet the win rate requirement. Your solution should implement strategic decision-making based on pattern recognition and opponent modeling.
