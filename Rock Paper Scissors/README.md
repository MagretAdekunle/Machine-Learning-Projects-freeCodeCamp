Requirements
------------

-   Implement an AI player that competes in Rock, Paper, Scissors matches
-   Your program must face four distinct opponent bots in separate matches
-   Achieve a minimum 60% win rate against each opponent
-   Each match should consist of a statistically significant number of games

Success Criteria
----------------

-   Win rate â‰¥ 60% against all four opponent bots
-   Consistent performance across multiple test runs

Note
----

Simple random selection will not be sufficient to meet the win rate requirement. Your solution should implement strategic decision-making based on pattern recognition and opponent modeling.
